# Aryan Ghait

**Software Engineer | Machine Learning & Systems**

I am a fundamentals-driven engineer with a strong focus on **machine learning systems**, **algorithmic problem solving**, and **production-ready software**. I value correctness, scalability, and long-term maintainability over short-term optimizations or hype.

My current focus is on strengthening core foundations in **data structures**, **ML theory**, and **system-level design**, while building systems that operate reliably in real-world environments.
